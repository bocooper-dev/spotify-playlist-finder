# Feature Specification: Spotify Playlist Discovery System

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-ai`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an AI application that can find popular Spotify playlists in a given set of music genres and return 50 playlists with the playlist URL and playlist owner contact information."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a music industry professional, content curator, or music enthusiast, I want to discover popular playlists within specific music genres so that I can identify trending content, connect with influential playlist curators, and explore genre-specific music communities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has access to the application, **When** they provide one or more music genre names, **Then** the system returns exactly 50 popular playlists from those genres
2. **Given** the system has found playlists, **When** displaying results, **Then** each playlist entry includes the playlist URL and owner contact information
3. **Given** a user searches for multiple genres, **When** the system returns results, **Then** playlists are ranked by popularity.
4. **Given** a user provides an unrecognized genre name, **When** they submit the search, **Then** the system provides clear feedback about which genres were not recognized
5. **Given** search results are returned, **When** the user reviews them, **Then** playlists are ordered by follower count.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when fewer than 50 playlists exist for the specified genres? Pad with related genres.
- How does system handle when playlist owner contact information is private? Show with partial info and mark as private. e.g., "Contact info not publicly available."
- What happens when user provides no genre input or empty values?
- How does system handle temporary unavailability of playlist data sources?
- What is the maximum number of genres that can be searched simultaneously? 10 genres.
- How are duplicate playlists across genres handled? Show only once.
- What defines "popular" for playlist ranking? Follower count primarily, with recency as a secondary factor.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept one or more music genre names as input
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate genre names against Spotify's official genres.
- **FR-003**: System MUST identify and retrieve playlists associated with specified genres
- **FR-004**: System MUST determine playlist popularity based on follower count and recent activity.
- **FR-005**: System MUST return exactly 50 playlists per search or padding with related genres if fewer exist.
- **FR-006**: For each playlist, system MUST provide the complete playlist URL
- **FR-007**: For each playlist, system MUST provide owner contact information including any and all available details including but not limited to username, email, social media, and profile URL.
- **FR-008**: System MUST present results in a structured, easily consumable format
- **FR-009**: System MUST complete searches within 2 minutes under normal load.
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle invalid or malformed genre inputs gracefully with user-friendly error messages
- **FR-011**: System MUST cache recent search results in local storage for retrieval.
- **FR-012**: System MUST respect Spotify's data usage and privacy policies.
- **FR-013**: Users MUST be able to export or save results in specific format as a CSV or JSON file.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Playlist**: A curated collection of music tracks with attributes including unique identifier, URL, name, description, genre tags, and popularity metrics
- **Playlist Owner**: The curator or creator of a playlist, including their display name, profile information, and available contact details
- **Genre**: A music category classification used to organize and filter playlists
- **Search Request**: User input containing one or more genre specifications and any search preferences
- **Search Results**: A collection of 50 playlist entries with associated metadata, ranked by popularity
- **Popularity Metrics**: Quantifiable measures used to rank playlists, including follower count and recent activity.
